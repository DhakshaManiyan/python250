#Exercise 152 - Loops
#Write code that will iterate over the range generated by range(9) and for each element that is between 3 and 7 inclusively print out the result of multiplying that element by the second element in the same range.

Hint: use nesting!
my_range = range(9)
 
for i in my_range:
    if 3 <= i <= 7:
        print(i * my_range[1])
