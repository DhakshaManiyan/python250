Exercise 239 - Classes
Considering the ClassOne and ClassTwo classes, where the latter is a child of the former, write code on line 15 in order to call the times10() method from the child class having x equal to 45, also printing the result to the screen.

class ClassOne(object):
    def __init__(self, p1, p2):
        self.p1 = p1
        self.p2 = p2
    
    def square(self, p3):
        print(p3 ** 2)
 
class ClassTwo(ClassOne):
    def times10(self, x):
        return x * 10
        
obj = ClassTwo(15, 25)
 
print(obj.times10(45))
