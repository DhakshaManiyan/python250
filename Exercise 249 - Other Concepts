Exercise 249 - Other Concepts
Use the correct function from the itertools module with a for loop and a nested if/else block in order to return all the numbers starting at 20 and up to 31 with a step of 2. Be careful not to end up with an infinite loop!
import itertools
 
for i in itertools.count(20, 2):
    if i < 31:
        print(i)
    else:
        break
