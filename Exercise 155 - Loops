#Exercise 155 - Loops
#Write a while loop that prints out the value of x times 11 while x is less than or equal to 11.  When x becomes equal to 10, print out x is 10! Be careful not to end up with an infinite loop!

x = 5
 
while x <= 11:
    if x == 10:
        print("x is 10!")
        x = x + 1
    else:
        print(x * 11)
        x = x + 1
