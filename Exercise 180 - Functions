#Exercise 180 - Functions
#Implement a function called my_func() that takes a single parameter x (a dictionary) and multiplies the number of elements in the dictionary with the largest key in the dictionary, also returning the result when the function is called.

def my_func(x):
    return len(x) * sorted(x.keys())[-1]
 
result = my_func({1: 3, 2: 3, 4: 5, 5: 9, 6: 8, 3: 7, 7: 0})
print(result)
