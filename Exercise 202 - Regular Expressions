Exercise 202 - Regular Expressions
Write code on line 5 in order to match the word Bitcoin at the beginning of the string using the match() method and ignoring the case. This way, no matter if you have bitcoin or Bitcoin, the match is done either way.

import re
 
s = "Bitcoin was born on Jan 3rd 2009 as an alternative to the failure of the current financial system. In 2017, the price of 1 BTC reached $20000, with a market cap of over $300B."
 
result = re.match("Bitcoin", s, re.I)
 
print(result.group())
