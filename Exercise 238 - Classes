Exercise 238 - Classes
Considering the ClassOne class, write code starting on line 9 to create a child class called ClassTwo that inherits from ClassOne and also has its own method called times10() that takes a single parameter x and prints out the result of multiplying x by 10.

class ClassOne(object):
    def __init__(self, p1, p2):
        self.p1 = p1
        self.p2 = p2
    
    def square(self, p3):
        print(p3 ** 2)
 
class ClassTwo(ClassOne):
    def times10(self, x):
        print(x * 10)
        
y = ClassTwo(10, 20)
print(y.p1)
